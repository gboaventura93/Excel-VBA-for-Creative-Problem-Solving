# Excel VBA for Creative Problem Solving

This course is offered by the University of Colorado Boulder on Coursera, taught by Charlie Nuttelman. 

I'm taking this course to strengthen my VBA skills, as I believe VBA is a crucial tool for data analysis and problem solving.

In this repository, Iâ€™ll be sharing my course assignments solutions.

#### OBS
If you download the Excel files, make sure to unblock the security option in the file's properties to enable editing of the Visual Basic content. </br>
